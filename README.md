# USRefugees2025
## Introduction
Under the Trump Administration, immigration enforcement has been significantly scaled up. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are common and widespread, and raids have even occurred at courthouses as immigrants were navigating the legal system. Similar tactics were instituted under Trumpâ€™s first administration in 2016-2020. Furthermore, refugee admissions have been frozen indefinitely, leaving an extremely vulnerable group of people with even less safety and security.

Inspired by these current events, this research aims to assess the treatment of refugees in the US by federal agencies across presidential administrations. To accomplish this, data from the Department of State on refugee admissions is compared with data from the Department of Homeland Security on refugee resettlements. Comparisons are then further drawn between all presidential administrations for which data is available, ranging from President Carter to President Biden.
