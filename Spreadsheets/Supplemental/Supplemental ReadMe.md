## TRAC - Transactions Records Access Clearing House

Data research organization based out of Syracuse University containing detailed immigration court data. Most data is behind an expensive paywall and difficult to access with the old UI. Some interesting data on Immigration, Customs, and Enfocement (ICE) was obtained but did not pertain to refugees/asylees in particular, so was excluded from final analysis.

## DHS - Department of Homeland Security

## CBP - Customs and Border Patrol

Data obtained from CBP on migrant encounters, primarily at the southern border. Was not specific to refugees/asylees, but could be useful in understanding use of force and overall agression trends.
